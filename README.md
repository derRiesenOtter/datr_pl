# README.md DATR PL

The data analysis was performed before some changes to the exercise were made. To have comparable
results the results were taken from another directory, where the data analysis was done after
all changes were made to the exercises: `/media/BioNAS/ag_hallab/DATR/Beck/`. The original
results for my analysis can be found here: `/media/BioNAS/ag_hallab/DATR/ender/`

The pipeline of exercise 6 was carried out on the bio cluster. The reports of exercise 6
and exercise 10 and 11 were carried out on the private computer.

## Exercise 6

### Exporting the results

All files needed for the further analysis were copied to a folder export and
exported to the private computer via:

```sh
scp -r studdatr@143.93.91.124:/media/BioNAS/ag_hallab/DATR/Beck/export ../material
```

## Reports for exercise 6
