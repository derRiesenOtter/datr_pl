\chapter{Introduction}

\section{questions to answer}
The Introduction mostly answers the following questions in a short manner:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the topic of this scientific publication?
	\item What is the current point of research?
	\item What materials and which methods were used to work on the topic?
	\item What is the hypothesis, that was to confirm or deny?
    \item This is an example for a citation (\cite{Beispiel1}). % Siehe dazu auch ./bibliography/resources.bib

\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction style}
An Introduction is written in plain text, and is usually written as one
paragraph of continuing text, although it is also possible to subdivide the
text into different partitions.
