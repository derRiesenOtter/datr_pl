\chapter*{Supplements}
The data analysis was performed before some changes to the exercise were made. To have comparable
results, the result data was taken from another student, where the data analysis was done after
all changes were made to the exercises: \\ 
/media/BioNAS/ag\_hallab/DATR/Beck/ \\ 
\newline
The original results for my analysis can be found here: 
\\ /media/BioNAS/ag\_hallab/DATR/ender/. \\ 
\newline

The analysis of the data pipeline was conducted on the personal computer. To make the analysis available,
they (scripts and results) are copied to the 
supplements folder of the zip file. They are also available on Github \href{https://github.com/derRiesenOtter/datr\_pl}{https://github.com/derRiesenOtter/datr\_pl} \\
\newline
The README.md file can also be found inside the supplements folder, or on Github.
