	abstract = {Gene expression is a biological process regulated at different molecular levels, including chromatin accessibility, transcription, and {RNA} maturation and transport. In addition, these regulatory mechanisms have strong links with cellular metabolism. Here we present a multi-omics dataset that captures different aspects of this multi-layered process in yeast. We obtained {RNA}-seq, metabolomics, and H4K12ac {ChIP}-seq data for wild-type and mip6Δ strains during a heat-shock time course. Mip6 is an {RNA}-binding protein that contributes to {RNA} export during environmental stress and is informative of the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to control cellular adaptations to environmental changes. The experiment was performed in quadruplicate, and the different omics measurements were obtained from the same biological samples, which facilitates the integration and analysis of data using covariance-based methods. We validate our dataset by showing that {ChIP}-seq, {RNA}-seq and metabolomics signals recapitulate existing knowledge about the response of ribosomal genes and the contribution of trehalose metabolism to heat stress. Raw data, processed data and preprocessing scripts are made available.},
